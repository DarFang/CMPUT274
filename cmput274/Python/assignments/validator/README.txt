Weekly Assignment 1: Password Validator
Citation: docs.python.org string and random module libraries


Running Instructions: The validate function inputs what is assumed to be a password and outputs it as either secure, insecure, or invalid. The generate inputs how long the password is. To edit the values, change the values in the "__main__" function.

Notes:
n is assumed to be 8>= when using the generate function. The libraries imported is string and random.
The string module was used to convert a number to a character, and random was used to shuffle the list created and generate a random integer to be converted to string.
